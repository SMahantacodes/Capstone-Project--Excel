# Capstone Project- Excel
This Excel Capstone Project focuses on analyzing operational data for a delivery service business, covering order behavior, customer performance, and delivery efficiencies. Using raw timestamped order data, I structured insights into order level distributions across time slots and regions, calculated slot-wise and day-wise completion rates, evaluated customer source effectiveness (such as Facebook, Instagram, and Google), and analyzed average delivery times by month and area. The project involved data cleaning, pivot analysis, time-based aggregations, and performance ranking, all done within Excel to simulate a real-world operational analytics workflow. The project highlights my ability to transform raw business data into meaningful insights through organized reporting, analytical breakdowns, and visual summarization.
